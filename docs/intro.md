## 🧭 learning roadmap

Learning Python works best through **logical, progressive stages**.
This roadmap takes you from your **first print statement** to **real-world projects**, reinforcing each concept with practice.

1. Install **Python 3** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Choose a code editor **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, or **Neovim**.
3. Verify installations:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

---

## 💬 Interactive mode

Python includes an **interactive shell** called the **REPL** short for **Read–Eval–Print–Loop**.
It’s one of the best ways to experiment, explore syntax, and test ideas instantly.

### 🧑‍💻 Launch the REPL

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
python
```

You’ll see:

```bash
>>> print("Hello, Python!")
Hello, Python!
```

### 💡 Why REPL?

✅ Test code snippets interactively

✅ Explore built-in functions (`help()`, `dir()`)

✅ Understand syntax and error messages

✅ Learn Python dynamically no setup needed

> 💬 Try typing `help(str)` to discover what Python strings can do.

## 🧩 Python basics

Start with the essentials before working with data structures:

* **Printing and comments** → `print()`, `#`
* **Variables and data types** → `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* **Operators** → arithmetic, comparison, logical
* **User input** → `input()`
* **Type conversion** → `int()`, `float()`, `str()`

🧠 *Goal:* Learn how Python represents and manipulates data.

---

## 🔄 Control structures

Control structures define **decision-making and repetition**:

* **Conditionals:** `if`, `elif`, `else`
* **Loops:** `for`, `while`
* **Loop control:** `break`, `continue`, `else`

---

## 🧮 Functions and scope

Functions make code **modular and reusable**.

Learn how to:

* Define functions with `def`
* Return values with `return`
* Pass arguments and parameters
* Use anonymous functions (`lambda`)
* Understand scope (`global`, `nonlocal`)

---

## 📦 Working with data structures

Python’s **core data containers** drive most applications:

1. **Lists** ordered, mutable collections
2. **Tuples** ordered, immutable collections
3. **Sets** unordered, unique elements
4. **Dictionaries** key-value mappings

---

## 🧱 Advanced data structures

Go beyond the basics with:

* Nested lists and flattening
* List and dictionary comprehensions
* Sorting and filtering
* Using `zip()`, `enumerate()`, and unpacking (`*args`, `**kwargs`)

---

## 🧰 File handling and data I/O

Learn how Python handles data:

* Read and write text files
* Parse CSV and JSON
* Handle exceptions with `try...except`

---

## 🧠 Object-oriented programming

Model real-world problems:

* Classes and attributes
* Constructors (`__init__`)
* Inheritance and polymorphism
* Encapsulation principles

---

## 🧮 Modules, packages, and virtual environments

* Import built-in and third-party libraries
* Create custom modules
* Manage dependencies with `pip` and `venv`

---

## 🔬 Intermediate python concepts

* Iterators and generators
* Decorators and closures
* Context managers (`with`)
* Exception handling hierarchies

---

## ⚙️ Working with APIs and external data

* Retrieve web data with `requests`
* Parse and manipulate JSON
* Automate workflows

---

## 🧩 Testing and debugging

* Write test cases using `unittest`
* Debug using `pdb` and `logging`
* Use assertions for validation

---

## 🚀 Advanced topics

* Functional programming (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
* Multithreading and multiprocessing
* Asynchronous programming (`async`, `await`)
* Static typing (`mypy`, `pylint`)

---

## 📊 Data science and real-world projects

* Use `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`
* Build small projects CSV analyzer, API dashboard
* Connect to databases such as SQLite or PostgreSQL

---
